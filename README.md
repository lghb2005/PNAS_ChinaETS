This repository contain the Stata code used in the study: Cui et al. "The effectiveness of China's regional carbon market pilots in reducing firm emissions". The code show the process of obtaining empirical results in the main text and supplementary information appendix.

This repository contains the following code scripts:

1. MainText(Mah).do -- the code that obtain the results in the main text, and summary statistics and balancing test in the supplementary information appendix.
2. Dynamic(09to15).do & Dynamic(07to15).do -- the code that plots the figures of dynamic effects on total emissions and emission intensity.
3. Robustness(AltMeas&Confound).do -- the code that run the robustness checks on alternative emission measurements and confounding factors.
4. Robustness(AltMatchNum).do -- the code that run the robustness checks on alternative matching numbers.
5. Robustness(AltCovSet1).do - Robustness(AltCovSet8).do -- the code that run the robustness checks on eight alternative sets of covariates in the matching procedure.
6. Robustness(PSM).do -- the code that employs propensity score matching (PSM) as an alternative method.
7. Robustness(IPTW).do -- the code that employs inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) as an alternative method.
8. Robustness(CEM).do --  the code that employs coarsened exact matching (CEM) as an alternative method.
9. Robustness(AltRateBased).do -- the code that run the robustness checks on alternative classifications for rate-based allowance allocation.
10. Robustness(HeteroSector).do -- the code that examine the heterogeneous effects by different sectors.
11. Robustness(HeteroPolicy).do -- the code that examine the policy heterogeneous effects (based upon carbon market performance) by diffferent alowance allocation methods.
